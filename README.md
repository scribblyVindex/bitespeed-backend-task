# Bitespeed Backend Test
If you are from Bitespeed, Hi! I'm Aditya.
This is the solution for the BiteSpeed Backend task.
The solution uses Prisma, PostgreSQL, ExpressJS, NodeJS, TypeScript and some brain-power.
Quite an interesting task, had fun doing it. Initially came up with one approach then as I understood more edge cases, I changed the approach a little bit.
The endpoint is hosted at http://task.adidev.me/identify, on a AWS EC2 instance. Also used NGINX for reverse proxy on the instance.

You can go ahead and examine the endpoint and the code in the repository, if you wanna know more about me drop by at www.adidev.me
